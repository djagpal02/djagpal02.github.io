							<h2>About Me<br />
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I have a strong mathematical background, with a focus on Probability, Statistics and Linear Algebra. These, combined with my passion for technology, have led to a deep interest in computational mathematics and computer science. I aspire to continuously develop these skills, in order to solve larger and more complex problems. My personal interests lie within quantitative finance, machine learning and most significantly; artificial intelligence.

								<h3>Pixel Adventure - Python/Tkinter Game</h3>

								<p>Pixel adventure is a 2D adventure game that takes the user through a story of saving the world, while battling many monsters. The game uses simple turn based battles to allow the user to defeat enemies. The user can do this to gain experience, level up, gain gold and complete missions. Enemies get stronger as the story progresses but the user also has the opportunity to get stronger via leveling up and purchasing items. Each level up comes with a boost in user AD (Attack Damage) and HP (Hit Points). Items serve many functions; some are necessary for entering particular areas, some give health boosts while in battle and others provide AD or HP boosts. Furthermore, Locations you can visit are locked based on story completion to encourage following the story. Since this game is unlikely to be finished in one sitting, the user has an option to save the game by visiting a bed. This save game can be restored from the start menu and can also be edited manually to change user profile by editing the users txt file.

								<h3>Django - Social Blog</h3>

							</div>
								<p>As part of my full stack web development course, I built a functioning social blog post site with a registration and login. This allows users to post on group pages and see where their friends have posted too. I created this with 3 django webapps, for accounts, groups and posts. This greatly increases potential for scalability.

							</div>
								<p>I built the backend for this app in Python connecting to a free rest api that provides real-time financial data for each security. I added a basic trend checking algorithm to look for correlation between different timeframes. I built the GUI around this using Tkinter.</p>
